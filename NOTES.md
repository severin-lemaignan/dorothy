The emergence of sociality
==========================


Emergence
---------


-> emergence? where to draw to frontier between available/implemented behaviours and emergent ones?


### Explicitely implemented:


solo playing

 - rules/playing heuristics
 - intrinsic motivation

### Emergent:

 - behavioural alignment
 - turn taking

### Blurry:

- joint attention


Approach
--------

Sociality as an optimisation problem

-> what is the reward?

 - at high level, engagement?
